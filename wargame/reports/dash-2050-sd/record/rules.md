# dash-2050: rules of the game (public; every player has the same text)

**Game master.** The game master (GM) runs the game on the narrowbody/widebody game-theory dashboard. Only the GM sees
the whole board. You see the public record and your own position. You never see another player's payoffs, finances,
orders or reasoning.

**Players.** Boeing and Airbus (airframers); CFM/GE, Pratt & Whitney (P&W) and Rolls-Royce (RR) (engine makers).

**Rounds.** Four decision years: 2030, 2035, 2045, 2050. In each round all five players submit sealed orders at the
same time. The GM adjudicates them and publishes a bulletin before the next round.

**Markets.**
- Narrowbody (NB): 2,000 aircraft a year. Status quo: Boeing 40%, Airbus 60%.
- Widebody (WB): 170 aircraft a year. Status quo: Boeing 787 58.8% (100/170), Airbus A350 41.2%.
- NB engines (two per aircraft): status quo CFM 76%, P&W 24%, RR 0%.
- WB engines: status quo CFM/GE (GEnx) 42%, RR (Trent) 58%.
- **Supply and demand is on in this game:** the narrowbody market is limited by what the factories can build; see the
  last section.

| RR | Trent 1000 upgrade (widebody) | `t1000_upgrade`: `launch` (exclusive with UltraFan WB) | counts 3 years after launch |
| RR | Do Nothing (continue Trent only) | `hold` | |

**Other moves.** You may also propose moves your company has historically made that are not on this list (for example
a pricing campaign, an alliance or a derivative aircraft). Put them in `other_moves` and say whether each is public.
The board does not price them. The GM records them, publishes the public ones, and reports them qualitatively; they
do not change any payoff.

**Launch once, cancel before service.** A launched programme can be cancelled in a later round, until it enters
service (airframes) or is ready (engines). A cancelled programme writes off its spend to date: the bill × years
elapsed ÷ development years, booked in the cancel year. A cancelled programme can be relaunched later as a new one.

## Engines on the new narrowbodies

- When Boeing launches fps or Airbus launches NGSA, it selects an engine code. Until the airframe enters service it
  may change the code in any round. The codes are 1 RR, 2 P&W, 3 CFM, 4 RR & P&W Joint Venture, 5 RR and CFM,
  6 P&W and CFM, 7 all three.
- A code is a request. A maker is fitted only if it has a new NB engine ready by the airframe's EIS: for P&W, GTF2 or
  the Joint Venture engine; for RR, UltraFan NB or the Joint Venture engine. CFM is always available (a LEAP
  derivative if it builds nothing new). A maker that is not ready is dropped. If no one is left, the airframe gets CFM.
- Code 4 needs a formed Joint Venture engine ready by EIS.
- Some code pairs are not allowed together: (1,1), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6),
  listed as (fps, NGSA). If both airframers choose such a pair, the later airframe moves to code 7.
- `launch_if_selected` (P&W GTF2, RR UltraFan NB): the engine launches this round only if a live airframe that is
  not yet in service has selected you this round, and your engine would be ready by its EIS. Otherwise nothing
  happens and nothing is spent.
- **Joint Venture.** P&W (`jv_with_rr: commit`) and RR (`jv_with_pw: commit`) each make a public, standing
  commitment. The Joint Venture forms in the first round in which both are committed. Its engine is ready 6 years
  later, or earlier if a partner folds in a solo programme that is further along. A solo programme folds into the
  Joint Venture when it forms; what the maker has spent on it beyond its Joint Venture share is written off in the
  fold year. A commitment can be withdrawn before the Joint Venture forms.
- Before a new airframe enters service, the 737 flies CFM (LEAP-1B) and the A320neo flies P&W and CFM.

## How the board sets market shares

**Narrowbody airframes.**
- Nothing changes until a new airframe enters service.
- **Only NGSA launched:** Airbus gains 3 pp a year from NGSA EIS (cap 80%).
- **Only fps launched:** Boeing gains 1.0 pp a year from fps EIS (cap 80%).
- **Both launched, different EIS years:** the first one to enter service gains 1.0 pp a year while it
  is alone (cap 80%). From the second EIS, shares move toward a long-run split at 1.0 pp a year
  (Boeing gaining) or 1.0 pp a year (Airbus gaining). The long-run split is 50/50 (Boeing/Airbus)
  shifted toward the first one by 1.0 pp for each year of lead (leader cap 80%), and the leader keeps
  that edge for good. Example: NGSA 2037 and fps 2041 give a long-run split of 46/54.
- **Both launched, same EIS year:** Boeing climbs from 40% toward 50% at 1.0 pp a year; no lead edge.
- The three fps moves (7-year, 10-year, via Embraer) follow the same rule: only the two EIS years matter.
- **737 rate increase:** Boeing gets +5 pp in 2032-36, or every year if neither new airframe is ever launched.
- **Delay Tactics:** Boeing loses 5 pp for 5 years from fps EIS.

**Widebody airframes.**
- A lone re-engined 787 gains 1.0 pp a year from its EIS (cap 85%).
- A lone re-engined A350 gains 1.5 pp a year (cap 60%).
- If both re-engine, the first one's gains stop when the second enters service. If both enter service in the same
  year, nothing changes.

**Engines.**
- Nothing changes until the first new narrowbody enters service; on the widebody, until the first re-engine (or 2042).
- From then on, each airframer's share of the NB market is split equally among the makers fitted to its airframe (the
  737 and A320neo slots as above). The engine moves then shift share:

| Engine move | Effect on engine share |
|---|---|
| CFM ducted | CFM +10 pp NB, taken from P&W (or half each from P&W and RR, if RR has an NB engine) |
| CFM Open Fan | Airframers will not wait for it. If the first new narrowbody enters service before Open Fan is ready, CFM loses 35 pp of NB share to the others (20 pp if CFM lobbies on emissions) |
| Partner Embraer | CFM +5 pp NB |
| GEnx upgrade or investment | CFM +5 pp WB |
| GTF2 Solo | P&W +10 pp NB (5 pp each from CFM and RR) |
| Joint Venture | P&W +5 pp and RR +5 pp NB, CFM −10 pp; P&W and RR then hold equal NB shares |
| UltraFan NB Solo | RR +15 pp NB (CFM −10 pp, P&W −5 pp) |
| UltraFan WB | RR +10 pp WB from CFM |
| Trent 1000 upgrade | RR +5 pp WB from CFM |

Shares are floored at zero and re-normalised to 100%.

**Payoffs.**
- Each player's score is the change in its present value (PV, $B at 2026) against the status quo, and its yield:
  100 + ΔPV ÷ enterprise value × 100.
- Airframers: operating profit on NB and WB aircraft, less programme investment (booked at EIS), a debt penalty,
  two-front strain, rate-increase cost, Delay Tactics spend and fines.
- Engine makers: lifetime value of engines delivered (engine price × a 1.6 lifecycle multiplier, with 2.2% a year
  price inflation), less R&D, strain and write-offs.
- Your own numbers are in your private brief.

## What is public

**Public:**
- launches, cancellations, entry-into-service and engine-ready dates;
- engine selections and the engines actually fitted;
- Joint Venture commitments;
- each player's `public_statement`, and any `other_moves` marked public;
- observed market shares and deliveries, year by year, up to the decision year.

**Private:** everything else: your payoffs, finances, orders not yet public, your rationale and your predictions.

**Delay Tactics** are covert: never published, and revealed only when the game ends.
- Each move (supply-chain bottleneck, talent poaching) costs $1B, spent over the years before fps EIS.
- One or both moves give the same 5 pp effect, from fps EIS.
- If Boeing never launches fps, the tactics are "naked" and draw a $48.32B fine.
- They can be ordered in any round before fps enters service.

## Supply and demand

The board's shares are what customers **want**. Aircraft are delivered only if a factory can build them.

**Demand = replacement + growth.**
- **Replacement:** the retirement of today's 737 MAX, A320neo-family and A220 fleets (Cirium fleet data, October
  2026): 114 a year in 2035, 562 in 2045, 853 in 2050.
- **Growth:** the single-aisle fleet grows about 4.0% a year to 2044 (Airbus and Boeing 2025 market
  forecasts), easing to 3% by 2060: 704 new aircraft a year for growth in 2030, 1037 in 2040,
  1378 in 2050.
- **Firm backlog:** 4,769 737 MAX and 7,330 A320neo-family aircraft on firm order (October 2026), broadly the
  replacement of the older 737NG and A320ceo fleets. They are delivered first and never switch maker or lapse.
- New demand (replacement + growth, 737/A320 class): 603 (2026), 714 (2030), 968 (2035),
  1373 (2040), 1802 (2045), 2232 (2050), 2274 (2055), 2129 (2060), on top of the firm backlog.

**Who customers want.** Each year's new demand is split by the board's share rules above: the **preference share**. The
fps, NGSA, the 737 rate increase's +5 pp and Delay Tactics all move preference; they move deliveries only where a
factory has the slots. The share objectives in your brief are measured on preference, as in earlier games.

**Factories (public production plans, aircraft a month).**
- **Airbus (Rev. B plan):** A320 family at 85 a month until NGSA enters service. Then, on the base plan, the A320
  lines wind down (72, 52, 42, then 14 a month, and none about five years after NGSA EIS) while NGSA ramps up
  (rate 50 about four years after EIS, 80 about six, 100 about eight). On the **Alt plan** (`a320_plan: alt`) the A320
  lines are kept longer (82, 62, 52, 42, then 14 a month, about eight years in all): about 1,500 more A320s for
  about $0.75B. Without NGSA the A320 stays at 85 a month.
- **Boeing:** 737 MAX at 42.5, 49.5, 52 and 54.5 a month in 2026-2029, then 57 from 2030
  (Renton's three lines at 47 plus the Everett North Line); the 737 rate increase adds 100 aircraft a year from
  2032 while the MAX is built. The fps ramps on the same shape as NGSA (rate 50 about four years after EIS, 100
  about eight). Boeing's single-aisle total is capped at 100 a month: as the fps fills it, the MAX gives way,
  down to an Everett tail of 10 a month. On the **new-site plan** (`fps_site: new_site`, the default) the fps is
  built at new sites and the MAX carries on at Renton and Everett. On the **Renton plan** (`fps_site: renton`) Renton is
  reassigned to the fps: its MAX lines (with the rate increase that rides on them) wind down as the fps ramps up, like
  the A320 base plan, and only the Everett North Line carries on (up to 15 a month); Boeing avoids about
  $3.0B of new-site capex, in full if Renton is chosen at least three years before the fps enters service
  (pro-rated if later). After 2050 the MAX builds only what the fps cannot yet: it tops Boeing up to the fps's full
  rate while the fps ramps. Without an fps the MAX carries on.

**Deliveries each year.**
- Each maker delivers its firm backlog first, then what its new customers want plus its waiting backlog, up to its
  capacity.
- Customers its factories cannot serve: the flexible ones (49%: airlines flying both types, lessors and
  unannounced customers) take the other maker's free slots, this year or in any later year when slots open; the rest
  wait in the backlog for their first choice.
- A tenth of the waiting backlog (not the firm backlog) drops out each year (keeps old aircraft longer, defers growth
  or cancels).
- New types are delivered first, up to their line's capacity; the rest are 737 MAX or A320neo, at today's price and
  margin.
- Market share in the observed tables is the share of deliveries. Profit is earned on aircraft delivered, at the
  board's prices and margins for each type.
- The status quo runs the same rules with today's plans (A320 at 85 a month, the MAX path above), the same demand and
  firm backlog, and the 40/60 preference.
- Engine makers sell engines on the aircraft actually delivered (two per aircraft). The 737 MAX keeps CFM (LEAP-1B)
  and the A320neo keeps CFM 60% / P&W 40%; the engine moves in the table above shift share only on the new types (fps
  and NGSA), starting from the makers fitted to each.

**Your supply plan** (`fps_site` for Boeing, `a320_plan` for Airbus) is public. It applies to your new airframe once
launched (you can choose it in the launch round) and can change in any round until that airframe enters service. A
field you leave out keeps your current plan. Supply-plan costs and savings are valued at your cost of capital (no debt
penalty).
