# dash-2050: rules of the game (public; every player has the same text)

**Game master.** The game master (GM) runs the game on the narrowbody/widebody game-theory dashboard. Only the GM sees
the whole board. You see the public record and your own position. You never see another player's payoffs, finances,
orders or reasoning.

**Players.** Boeing and Airbus (airframers); CFM/GE, Pratt & Whitney (P&W) and Rolls-Royce (RR) (engine makers).

**Rounds.** Four decision years: 2030, 2035, 2045, 2050. In each round all five players submit sealed orders at the
same time. The GM adjudicates them and publishes a bulletin before the next round.

**Markets.**
- Narrowbody (NB): 2,000 aircraft a year. Status quo: Boeing 40%, Airbus 60%.
- Widebody (WB): 170 aircraft a year. Status quo: Boeing 787 58.8% (100/170), Airbus A350 41.2%.
- NB engines (two per aircraft): status quo CFM 76%, P&W 24%, RR 0%.
- WB engines: status quo CFM/GE (GEnx) 42%, RR (Trent) 58%.

## Moves and timing

| Boeing | Launch fps with 10-year ramp-up | `fps`: `launch_10yr` | EIS 10 years after launch |
| Boeing | Launch fps via Embraer | `fps`: `launch_via_embraer` | EIS 10 years after launch |

| RR | UltraFan narrowbody Solo | `ultrafan_nb_solo`: `launch` or `launch_if_selected` | ready 7 years after launch |
| RR | Joint Venture with P&W | `jv_with_pw`: `commit` | see Joint Venture |
| RR | UltraFan widebody | `ultrafan_wb`: `launch` | ready 6 years after launch; counts only once a re-engined 787 or A350 is in service |
| RR | Trent 1000 upgrade (widebody) | `t1000_upgrade`: `launch` (exclusive with UltraFan WB) | counts 3 years after launch |
| RR | Do Nothing (continue Trent only) | `hold` | |

**Other moves.** You may also propose moves your company has historically made that are not on this list (for example
a pricing campaign, an alliance or a derivative aircraft). Put them in `other_moves` and say whether each is public.
The board does not price them. The GM records them, publishes the public ones, and reports them qualitatively; they
do not change any payoff.

**Launch once, cancel before service.** A launched programme can be cancelled in a later round, until it enters
service (airframes) or is ready (engines). A cancelled programme writes off its spend to date: the bill × years
elapsed ÷ development years, booked in the cancel year. A cancelled programme can be relaunched later as a new one.

## Engines on the new narrowbodies

- When Boeing launches fps or Airbus launches NGSA, it selects an engine code. Until the airframe enters service it
  may change the code in any round. The codes are 1 RR, 2 P&W, 3 CFM, 4 RR & P&W Joint Venture, 5 RR and CFM,
  6 P&W and CFM, 7 all three.
- A code is a request. A maker is fitted only if it has a new NB engine ready by the airframe's EIS: for P&W, GTF2 or
  the Joint Venture engine; for RR, UltraFan NB or the Joint Venture engine. CFM is always available (a LEAP
  derivative if it builds nothing new). A maker that is not ready is dropped. If no one is left, the airframe gets CFM.
- Code 4 needs a formed Joint Venture engine ready by EIS.
- Some code pairs are not allowed together: (1,1), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6),
  listed as (fps, NGSA). If both airframers choose such a pair, the later airframe moves to code 7.
- `launch_if_selected` (P&W GTF2, RR UltraFan NB): the engine launches this round only if a live airframe that is
  not yet in service has selected you this round, and your engine would be ready by its EIS. Otherwise nothing
  happens and nothing is spent.
- **Joint Venture.** P&W (`jv_with_rr: commit`) and RR (`jv_with_pw: commit`) each make a public, standing
  commitment. The Joint Venture forms in the first round in which both are committed. Its engine is ready 6 years
  later, or earlier if a partner folds in a solo programme that is further along. A solo programme folds into the
  Joint Venture when it forms. A commitment can be withdrawn before the Joint Venture forms.
- Before a new airframe enters service, the 737 flies CFM (LEAP-1B) and the A320neo flies P&W and CFM.

## How the board sets market shares

**Narrowbody airframes.**
- Nothing changes until a new airframe enters service.
- If NGSA enters service first, Airbus gains 3 pp a year (cap 80%).
- If fps enters service first, Boeing gains 1.0 pp a year (cap 80%).
- When the second airframe enters service, its maker climbs toward 50% at 1.0 pp a year if it is below
  50%; otherwise shares stay where they are.
- If both enter service in the same year, Boeing climbs from 40% toward 50%.
- **fps 7-year ramp-up:** Boeing gets +5 pp for 10 years from fps EIS.
- **737 rate increase:** Boeing gets +5 pp in 2032-36, or every year if neither new airframe is ever launched.
- **Delay Tactics:** Boeing loses 5 pp for 5 years from fps EIS.

**Widebody airframes.**
- A lone re-engined 787 gains 1.0 pp a year from its EIS (cap 85%).
- A lone re-engined A350 gains 1.5 pp a year (cap 60%).
- If both re-engine, the first one's gains stop when the second enters service. If both enter service in the same
  year, nothing changes.

**Engines.**
- Nothing changes until the first new narrowbody enters service; on the widebody, until the first re-engine (or 2035).
- From then on, each airframer's share of the NB market is split equally among the makers fitted to its airframe (the
  737 and A320neo slots as above). The engine moves then shift share:

| Engine move | Effect on engine share |
|---|---|
| CFM ducted | CFM +10 pp NB, taken from P&W (or half each from P&W and RR, if RR has an NB engine) |
| CFM Open Fan | Airframers will not wait for it. If the first new narrowbody enters service before Open Fan is ready, CFM loses 35 pp of NB share to the others (20 pp if CFM lobbies on emissions) |
| Partner Embraer | CFM +5 pp NB |
| GEnx upgrade or investment | CFM +5 pp WB |
| GTF2 Solo | P&W +10 pp NB (5 pp each from CFM and RR) |
| Joint Venture | P&W +5 pp and RR +5 pp NB, CFM −10 pp; P&W and RR then hold equal NB shares |
| UltraFan NB Solo | RR +15 pp NB (CFM −10 pp, P&W −5 pp) |
| UltraFan WB | RR +10 pp WB from CFM |
| Trent 1000 upgrade | RR +5 pp WB from CFM |

Shares are floored at zero and re-normalised to 100%.

**Payoffs.**
- Each player's score is the change in its present value (PV, $B at 2026) against the status quo, and its yield:
  100 + ΔPV ÷ enterprise value × 100.
- Airframers: operating profit on NB and WB aircraft, less programme investment (booked at EIS), a debt penalty,
  two-front strain, rate-increase cost, Delay Tactics spend and fines.
- Engine makers: lifetime value of engines delivered (engine price × a 1.6 lifecycle multiplier, with 2.2% a year
  price inflation), less R&D, strain and write-offs.
- Your own numbers are in your private brief.

## What is public

**Public:**
- launches, cancellations, entry-into-service and engine-ready dates;
- engine selections and the engines actually fitted;
- Joint Venture commitments;
- each player's `public_statement`, and any `other_moves` marked public;
- observed market shares and deliveries, year by year, up to the decision year.

**Private:** everything else: your payoffs, finances, orders not yet public, your rationale and your predictions.

**Delay Tactics** are covert: never published, and revealed only when the game ends.
- Each move (supply-chain bottleneck, talent poaching) costs $1B, spent over the years before fps EIS.
- One or both moves give the same 5 pp effect, from fps EIS.
- If Boeing never launches fps, the tactics are "naked" and draw a $48.32B fine.
- They can be ordered in any round before fps enters service.
